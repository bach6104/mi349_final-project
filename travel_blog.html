                    We all must have fly a plane once in our life. Being able to receive the privilege similar to birds, gliding through the clouds in the sky, looking everything from up above...

            <p>Travelling by plane has been one of the most efficient way of transportation between 2 destinations. But this efficient comes with a price, unlike mobile vehicle, the operation price of a plane is enormous, therefore, the plane ticket of the passenger is usually high.</p> 

            <p>As a international student, every time I want to go home during breaks, that seems possible with the price of the plane tickets, since my home is halfway around earth, the plane ticket is more expensive comparing to the ticket to other places. Therefore, to be able to not going bankrupt after purchasing a plane ticket, I want to minimize the money I spent buying the ticket. In this blog, I will show some of the tricks and tips I did to be able to purchase the plane ticket at low prices.</p>

            <p>For international flight, you would want to monitor the prices of the ticket 6 months before the departure day. By comparing the prices, you would see what is the average prices and you can determine what is the lowest prices of them all. Some of the sites that we can use to check for plane tickets are Google flight, Skyscanner, and Expedia, these are some of the prices that are trustworthy, but be careful of 3rd parties website since they usually have bad reviews or bad customer services or fake flight tickets that does not reflect their actual price.</p>

            <p>For domestic flight, you would want to check up the flight 2 months before the flight departure since airlines usually have better flight schedule during that time. Since we are in Lansing, Michigan, which is quite the middle of the US, in order to get the cheaper flights, we would want to go to bigger plane hub such as ORD or JFK.  </p>

        <h2>2. Japan and what to do when we have long layover ?</h2>

                    Flying directly would set us back a fortune if we want to travel by plane, for that reason, we would usually choose flights that have layovers at middle countries between the 2 destinations...
                </p>
        <div class="full-content collapse" id="post2">
            <p>Sometime, we would have to go through customs or we would stay at lounges to wait for our next flight. Having a few hours layover is a casual thing for me since I usually travels with the cheapest flight and since my destination is in Michigan, I usually have to pick to either fly to the West with a stop in San Francisco and another stop in some of the Asian countries or I would have to go to New York with a stop in some Middle East countries. I really enjoy flying to new destinations and exploring their countries. 
            </p>
            <p>In this case of having a long layover with more than 8 hours in a transit country, sitting in a airport with be a waste and really boring. In this article, I will guide you on what to do if you have a long layover in Japan. Coming to Japan, you can not go outside if you are not a citizen of the countries that does not require Visa to enter or you either have a visa. In most case, as a tourist, having a long layover in Japan, you can apply for the Japan shore pass to get access to Japan. </p>
            <p>
            After getting the visa or shore pass, you are able to enter Japan and explore the country. There is a few thing you need to consider when exploring Japan. First, People will usually transit at Narita International Airport or Haneda International Airport. Haneda is in Tokyo while Narita is in Chiba, which is an hour train from Tokyo. If you land in Haneda, there is nothing to worry, you just need to get out of the Airport and explore, but if you land in Narita, you would want to consider buying a train ticket to Tokyo. You can be a Keisei Train ticket which would set you back around 26 dollars and it would take you around 1 hour to reach Tokyo. Once you have reach Tokyo, you can go to other famous near by places such as Akihabara, Shibuya or Shinjuku. There is a lot of activities and goods to buy in Japan, if you buy a lot of things and you are not able to fit in your bad, there will be some shops near Ueno station where they sell really cheap suitcase.
